### Introduction

This application will provide logistics and visualization for publicly accessible FDIC data, as well as a demonstration which answers the question, do larger banks take higher risks due to a too-big-to-fail status?

The relationship between bank size and risk-taking is alleged by many to have contributed to the infamous financial crisis of 2007-08, in which a wave of bank failures overwhelmed the institutions of banking insurance. The government consequently funded the stabilization of the banking industry under the threat that its collapse would severely impact the rest of the economy. 

Many critics of the bailout’s recipients alleged that the large banks had factored their too big to fail statuses into the riskiness of their policies, increasing their potential profits at the expense of the public.

To assess the plausibility of this accusation, this demonstration will explore relationships between six FDIC variables for all banks: 

<li>asset  - total assets;  </li>

<li>numemp - Total employees (full-time equivalent);</li>

<li>rbc1rwaj - tier 1 risk-based capital;  </li>

<li>RBCT2 - tier 2 risk-based capital; </li>

<li>rbcrwaj - total risk-based capital ratio; and </li>

<li>RWAJT - total risk weighted assets adjusted.</li>


In addition to quantifying these relationships, this demonstration will discuss the theoretical limitations of its results.

By providing descriptive and predictive statistical analyses, including intuitive visualizations of FDIC data, this application will assist bank regulators and officers in calculating the risk positions of banks.
