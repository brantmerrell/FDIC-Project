These charts describe the "time summary data.csv" file found at https://github.com/brantmerrell/FDIC-Project. It consists of six variables for 90 quarters from 1992 to 2015. The variables were selected by typing the words "size" and "risk" into the glossary of short descriptions of FDIC variables at bankerdoodle.com, and each was summarized with the Minimum, Median, Mean, Max, and Sum in the "time summary data.R" file, which draws on data from the "modified" folder. The "modified" folder was constructed by the explore.R file, which downloaded data from FDIC.gov, stored all files with any of the six variables in the rawFiles folder, then piped the rawFiles folder to the "modified" folder, in the process eliminating all variables other than the six selected.
