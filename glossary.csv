Use most recent or historical reporting dates to identify the impact of mergers and other events. Agricultural Banks - An institution with agricultural loans totaling at least 25% of total loans. Banks Headquartered in the U.S. with Foreign Offices - Commercial banks that file a FFIEC 031 Call Report as required for those institutions with both domestic and foreign offices. Banks Directly Owned by Another Bank - Beginning in March 1997, both the Thrift Financial Reports and Call Reports are completed on a fully consolidated basis. Previously, the consolidation of subsidiary depository institutions was prohibited. Now, parent institutions are required to file consolidated reports, while their subsidiary financial institutions are still required to file separate reports. Trust Powers Granted Institutions that have been granted trust powers by a state or national regulatory authority to administer accounts in a fiduciary capacity. Fiduciary capacity generally means: trustee, executor, administrator, registrar of stocks and bonds, transfer agent, guardian, assignee, receiver, custodian under a uniform gifts to minors act, investment advisor, any capacity in which the institution possesses investment discretion on behalf of another, or any similar capacity. Trust or Related Activity Beyond having granted and exercised trust powers, institutions that have fiduciary assets accounts, income, or other reportable fiduciary related service. Credit Card Institutions - Institutions with total loans greater than 50% of total assets and credit card loans greater than 50% of total loans, including loans that have been securitized and sold. Federal Charter - Nationally chartered commercial banks or OTS chartered savings associations Institutions with Interstate Branches - Institutions that have branches in more than one state that can accept deposits insured by the FDIC. Mutual (non-stock) Savings Institution - A non-stock institution owned and controlled by its depositors. A mutual does not issue capital stock. All commercial banks issue stock and are not mutuals. State Charter - FDIC-insured, state chartered banks that are either members or non-members of the Federal Reserve System Stock Held Institution - A stock institution sells stock to raise capital. It is owned by the shareholders who benefit from profits earned by the institution. Subchapter S Corporations - The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 changed the Internal Revenue Code to allow financial institutions to elect Subchapter S corporation status, beginning in 1997. A Subchapter S corporation is treated as a pass-through entity, similar to a partnership, for federal income tax purposes. It is generally not subject to any federal income taxes at the corporate level. Its taxable income flows through to its shareholders in proportion to their stock ownership, and the shareholders generally pay federal income taxes on their share of this taxable income. This can have the effect of reducing institutions' reported taxes and increasing their after-tax earnings. The election of Subchapter S status may result in an increase in shareholders' personal tax liability. Therefore, some S corporations may increase the amount of earnings distributed as dividends to compensate for higher personal taxes.","Additional Option.csv","alpha"

Under such an arrangement, the policyholder neither owns the underlying separate account created by the insurance carrier on its behalf nor controls investment decisions in the underlying account, but does assume all investment and price risk. separate accounts are employed by life insurers to meet specific investment objectives of policyholders. the accounts are often maintained as separate accounting and reporting entities for pension plans as well as fixed benefit, variable annuity, and other products. investment income and investment gains and losses generally accrue directly to such policyholders and are not accounted for on the general accounts of the insurer. on the books of the insurer, the carrying values of separate account assets and liabilities usually approximate each other with little associated capital. Because they are legally segregated, the assets of each separate account are not subject to claims on the insurer that arise out of any other business of the insurance company.Data available as of March 2011 for Call Reports only, not available for TFR filers.

160,"fdic-sdi-data","Oalifhyb","Hybrid life insurance assets","The amount of the bank’s holdings of life insurance assets associated with hybrid account insurance policies. A hybrid account insurance policy combines features of both general and separate account insurance products. Similar to a general account life insurance policy, a hybrid policy offers a guaranteed minimum crediting rate, does not carry market value risk, and does not require stable value protection. However, like a separate account life insurance policy, a hybrid policy’s cash surrender value is supported by assets segregated from the general assets of the insurance carrier. Because they are legally segregated, the assets of each separate account are not subject to claims on the insurer that arise out of any other business of the insurance company. Additionally, the bank holding the hybrid account life insurance policy is able to select the investment strategy in which the insurance premiums are invested. Under such an arrangement, the policyholder neither owns the underlying separate account created by the insurance carrier on its behalf nor controls investment. data available as of march 2011 for call reports only, not available for tfr filers.

Futures and forward contracts are contracts in which the buyer agrees to purchase and the seller agrees to sell, at a specified future date, a specific quantity of underlying at a specified price or yield. These contracts exist for a variety of underlyings, including traditional agricultural or physical commodities, as well as currencies and interest rates. Futures contracts are standardized and are traded on organized exchanges which set limits on counterparty credit exposure. Forward contracts do not have standardized terms and are traded over the counter.  Option contracts are contracts in which the buyer acquires the right to buy from or sell to another party some specified amount of underlying at a stated price (strike price) during a period or on a specified future date, in return for compensation (such as a fee or premium). The seller is obligated to purchase or sell the underlying at the discretion of the buyer of the contract. Swaps are obligations between two parties to exchange a series of cash flows at periodic intervals (settlement dates) for a specified period. The cash flows of a swap are either fixed or determined for each settlement date by multiplying the quantity of the underlying instrument (notional principal) by specified reference rates or prices. Except for currency swaps, the notional principal is used to calculate each payment but is not exchanged.  This item is not available for TFR Reporters.","Assets and Liabilities.csv;

314,"fdic-sdi-data","subchaps","Subchapter S Corporations","The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 changed the Internal Revenue Code to allow financial institutions to elect Subchapter S corporation status, beginning in 1997. Banks are required to indicate on the Call Report whether there is currently in effect an election to file under Subchapter S. Thrifts have a similar requirement as of March 1998.  The most important IRS requirements to elect and maintain Subchapter S status are: There can be no more than 75 eligible shareholders and no more than one class of stock. (In general, shareholders can only be individuals, estates, and certain types of trusts. Certain retirement plans and charitable organizations will be eligible in 1998.) All shareholders must consent.  Banks and thrifts converting to Subchapter S status must use the specific charge-off method for tax purposes rather than the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and recapture tax bad debt reserves over a period of six years, if the reserve method had been used prior to conversion. (Note: even though the specific charge-off method is required for tax purposes, an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses must still be maintained on the financial statements and Call Reports.) Banks and thrifts are subject to a built-in gains (BIG) tax, if the aggregate fair market value of assets is greater than their aggregate adjusted bases on the date of conversion to Subchapter S status.     [Banks are required to indicate separately on the Call Report in December of each year, the deferred portion of income taxes reported in net income. For Subchapter S banks, some or all of their deferred tax assets and liabilities may be eliminated upon conversion to Subchapter S status; however, deferred taxes related to the BIG tax and the recapture of bad debt reserves must be recognized.].   A Subchapter S corporation is treated as a pass-through entity, similar to a partnership, for federal income tax purposes. It is generally not subject to any federal income taxes at the corporate level. Its taxable income flows through to its shareholders in proportion to their stock ownership, and the shareholders generally pay federal income taxes on their share of this taxable income. This can have the effect of reducing institutions' reported income tax expense and increasing their after-tax earnings..   The election of Subchapter S status may result in an increase in shareholders' personal tax liabilities. Therefore, S corporations typically increase the amount of earnings distributed as dividends to compensate for higher personal taxes.","Demographic Information.csv","numeric"

Goodwill and similar intangible assets ordinarily cannot be disposed of apart from an institution as a whole. Accordingly, a bank may not remove goodwill from its balance sheet by 'selling' or 'dividending' this asset to its parent holding company or another affiliate. An exception to the rule precluding the disposal of goodwill is made when a large segment or separable group of assets of an acquired company or an entire acquired company is sold or otherwise liquidated. In that case, some or all of the unamortized goodwill recognized in the acquisition should be included in the cost of the assets sold. The amount of goodwill reported in this item should not be reduced by any negative goodwill.

In general, purchased credit card relationships are an amount paid in excess of the value of the purchased credit card receivables. Such relationships arise when the reporting bank purchases existing credit card receivables and also has the right to provide credit card services to those customers. Purchased credit card relationships may also be acquired when the reporting bank purchases an entire depository institution. Purchased credit card relationships are carried at amortized cost, not in excess of the discounted amount of estimated future net cash flows. Management of the institution reviews the carrying value at least quarterly, adequately documents this review, and adjusts the carrying value as necessary. If unanticipated acceleration or deceleration of cardholder payments, account attrition, changes in fees or finance charges, or other events occur that reduce the amount of expected future net cash flows, a write-down of the book value of the purchased credit card relationships is made to the extent that the discounted amount of estimated future net cash flows is less than the asset's carrying amount. The carrying value of nonmortgage servicing assets is the unamortized cost of acquiring contracts to service financial assets, other than loans secured by real estate, that have been securitized or are owned by another party, net of any related valuation allowances.
